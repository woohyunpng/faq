				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is your name? Who are you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I’m Kenia! I’m 21 and I've been a Nu'est fan since their debut but I've only recently joined the community. I'm also a huge fan of Wanna One, The Boyz, Rainz, JBJ, and all the trainees in Produce 101</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What GOs do you open?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> I open GOs for Wanna One, Nu'est, and Produce 101 boys. I am open to JBJ, Rainz, the Boyz GOs but at the moment my main focus is Nu'est.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you take requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Requests open and close. At the moment they are closed. If they open again my bio will have that information.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What countries do you ship to?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I prefer if buyers are from the US or Canada but I will accept international orders as long as buyers are willing to pay any extra fees and understand that i am not responsible if anything should happen to the goods during international shipping. 
					<br><br>
					I also CANNOT calculate rates until I have the item so please do not DM me asking how much it'll cost to ship abroad. Keep in mind the heaver something is, the more expensive it will be. 
					<br><br>
					Please do not join my orders unless you are willing to pay fees if they do turn out to be high. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the most important things to remember?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>-Always use Friends and Family on PayPal if you are in the US. If you pay with Goods and Services your payment will be refunded. 
					<br><br>
					-If you use PayPal don't write ANYTHING in the notes
					<br><br>
					-Please check your emails!
					<br><br>
					- Please let me know your country only has the Goods and Services option on PayPal. If I don't know this, I will refund your payment. 
					<br><br>
					-I can't give you an estimate for international shipping if you are outside the US
					<br><br>-EMS fees will always be under $5 unless otherwise noted.
					<br><br>-GOS will never include EMS or domestic fees unless otherwise noted </p>

		<ul id="goinfo" class="cd-faq-group">
			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO Info</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do GOs work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I ask the seller or fansite if they are open to overseas orders and if there are any other GOs for the US. If there is a GO already I will not open one. Please don't request (if requests are open) if something already has a US GOM!
					<br><br>
					Once I get the okay, I make a tweet and once the details are finalized (i.e. how much the goods will cost, etc.) then I open a form.
					<br><br>The form will usually close 1 or 2 days before the deadline just in case anything goes wrong with my deposit. If there is a minimum and I don’t hit it, then I refund everyone. Once the deadline arrives, I close the form and send the 1st payment.
					<br><br>The seller or fansite will then have the goods in production and when they’re done they will ship to my Korean address. Once at my Korean address, I’ll get an EMS estimate which I will split among the buyers. 
					<br><br>As soon as every buyer pays their share, I will send the payment and the goods will be shipped to my house in California. From there, I will see how much domestic or international shipping is and send out emails about the fees to each buyer.
					<br><br>Once domestic shipping is paid, I’ll finally ship the goods to each buyer~
					<br><br>Sometimes if things have been delayed already, I'll pay for EMS/DHL out of pocket and then send out fee emails for that. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you have a Korean address? How do Korean addresses work</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I use Korgou as my Korean address. It is a warehouse where goods arrive and are placed in my inventory where they wait until I am ready to combine orders for a shipment to my house. <br><br>
					Korgou provides me with an address that I use to fill out forms. Sometimes I will also give that address out (such as in the case of fanclub membership GOs) so that others can also benefit from combining shipments to reduce EMS.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you have a Korean bank account? Is it really your own?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, I have a "Korean bank account" but it does not mean it's my own account. I use Korgou and SendHow to send payments via bank transfer to sellers and fansites.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does GO/GOM/IO/EMS/DHL mean?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>GO stands for group order. <br>
					GOMs are group order managers<br>
					IO stands for individual order<br>
					EMS is Express Mail Service and it is a shipping service<br>
					DHL is also a shipping service that is very similar to EMS. Both EMS and DHL are fast (2-3 business days) but can get pricey.

						You can also see what orders are open by going to my pinned tweet and looking at the "Open Orders" thread under it. <br><br>If there is an item that you want to order but I do not have a GO for it, feel free to request ONLY if my requests are open.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I have a question about something I am ordering- can I DM you?</a>

					<p>Please leave DMs as a last option- I get a lot of them so messages get buried very quickly. If you are confused about something I prefer questions through Curious Cat <a href="https://curiouscat.me/minsbugi" target="_blank">here</a> or through email @ kennniaa@gmail.com</p>

					<p>If you are dropping out before the deadline- then yes. However, if you want to drop out after the deadline you'll have to find someone to take your spot. If you do not find someone to take your spot then you will have to wait until I sell your goods to receive your refund</p>

		<ul id="ios" class="cd-faq-group">
			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Individual Orders</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are individual orders/IOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Individual orders (I've also heard them called one-offs and personal orders) are orders where instead of multiple people involved there is only 1 (or 2 sometimes). </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How are IOs different from GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>IOs are less formal than GOs. There is no form for each item, rather you use the general <a href="https://goo.gl/DYP2yZ" target="_blank">individual order form</a> to place an order and the payment info will be sent in the confirmation email.
						<br> <br>
					Unlike GOs, the price for an item in an IO will include the domestic shipping fee within Korea (i.e. the fee for the item to be delivered to my warehouse) and the bank transfer fee.
					<br><br>
					There is no minimum for joining an IO but there is a maximum which will be on my <a href="https://goo.gl/vHjz7z" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> 
					</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's the IO process? How do they work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The process goes like this
					<br><br>

					1) An individual order is placed - Please make sure it is well before the deadline and if the deadline is on the weekend in Korea, the latest you can submit an order for it is Thursday (in California time) of that week. Please keep timezones in mind!!
					<br><br>
					2) I go over your order and determine if it's possible (i.e. is there stock, is the deadline reasonable). If it is not, I'll send you a DM about it. If it is possible you will get a confirmation email with the price of the goods in USD and the domestic shipping in Korea (which is usually around $3)
					<br><br>
					3) Once I receive the money, I deposit  and place the order.
					<br><br>
					4) Once goods arrive at my Korean address, I wait until there are enough other goods so that EMS is cheap for you. Previous individual orders I've done have had EMS around $2 - $3. This means your order might take longer than normal (especially if I have to wait for more orders to reach my K-address). Please keep this in mind when you order. Please do not ask me for a time estimate because I can't give you one.
					<br><br>
					5) Once I know EMS, I send you an email. After it's paid, I have the items shipped to me
					<br><br>
					6) When items are at my US house I send another email with a link to the domestic shipping form. After you fill it out I'll send you an email with the different rates. Once you pay your desired rate, I package and ship your item! </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long do IOs take?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This will depend on the goods ordered. If you ordered a doll, for example, it takes between 4 to 6 months. If you ordered a slogan, it can take between 1 to 2 months. Stickers and other small items can take up to a month. 
						<br><br>
						In addition to this, it can take up to a week or two after the IO has arrived at my Korean warehouse for it to ship to my house because I have to wait until there are enough other goods so EMS/DHL is cheap for you.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm worried about EMS fees- are they high for IOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No- because I combine lots of orders before shipping to my house, EMS/DHL for IOs will always be under $5</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>


			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where can I see updates on my IO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

<ul id="payments" class="cd-faq-group">
			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Payments</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are my payment options?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I accept PayPal and Venmo only. I only accept Friends and Family on PayPal unless your country does not allow that option- in which case please let me know BEFORE you pay or I will refund your payment.
					</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do I have to pay right away when submitting a form?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No, you have until the deadline to pay. If you do not pay before the deadline your order will be dropped. Do not ask to make an exception. <br><br>
						However, if you talk to me BEFORE the deadline and let me know you'll need more time to pay, I will give you an extension that works with your circumstances, but you MUST pay before that extension or else I will drop you from the order and that will count as a strike against you.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do I have to use Friends and Family?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The IRS has been known to target accounts that receive a lot of Goods and Services payments and sometimes PayPal locks accounts which means the money there cannot be used. This is why I insist on Friends and Family for buyers from the US (and other countries that support it). </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happens if I miss a payment?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you miss the 1st payment without letting me know your circumstances, then you are dropped from the order. If you missed the 2nd payment without letting me know your circumstances, I will withhold your goods and you have to wait until I sell them in order to get a refund. This will also count as a strike against you.
						<br><br>

						If you asked for an extention before the deadline and then you also missed that 2nd deadline (after I have paid for your order) then I will put your goods up for reclaim and you will be placed on a banned list.
						<br><br> Do not take advantage of my kindness.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>


			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I don't want the item I ordered anymore, can I get a refund?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you ask for a refund BEFORE the deadline, yes. If it is AFTER the deadline, then you have to wait until someone else buys your order.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I sent the wrong payment/double payment- can I get a refund for the excess?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes! Please reply to your confirmation email with proof of the incorrect payment. Do note that refunds are slow because I have a lot of things to take care of.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I pay in installments?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I will allow installments on a case to case basis and you must have ordered with me at least twice and have good standing (no strikes).</p>

					<p>I am copying and pasting from a CC I got about this: 
						<br><br>

					As far as starting goes, I didn't start conventionally. This was actually a personal account, I had no korean address, and my first GO had a very sloppy form, no confirmation emails, barely any updates, my masterlist was nonexistent, my domestic shipping was sO messy, and I sent about a million emails to Korgou (once I found them) because I had no ides what I was doing :') There's slightly more detail about how I started in <a href="https://curiouscat.me/minsbugi/post/221221113?t=1508472397" target="_blank">this CC</a>.

Some other GOMs I know started more conventionally so in the off chance you're thinking of being a GOM, I would go to them about starting:

I know you said other than p101 boys but I just want to promote my faves Rainz (bias: Kiwon) and JBJ (bias: Longguo), Yoo Hoyeon + Kim Yeonkuk (they're in a group called Noir now) and some of my undebuted faves: Yehyeon, Yuehua sprouts, RBW boys (especially Gunmin!!), and MMO boys (especially Jinwoo!!). 
<br><br>
I'm also super in love with The Boyz and Golcha right now- I've finished both of their predebut shows and I love watching Golcha perform (pls vote Golcha for best new artist sorry not sorry @ Wanna One) ;; 
<br><br>
I used to be a hardcore VIXX and EXO stan but now I'm more of a casual fan of them and BTS/BTOB/B1A4. Some groups I'm currently getting to know better are Seventeen (I knew OF them but didn't really know them too well), SF9 (O Sole Mio changed my life??), ONF, and Stray Kids. 
<br><br>
For girl groups I love all of them, but specifically: Melody Day, Red Velvet, EXID, Gfriend, SNSD (rip my ult gg), Wonder Girls (rip), After School (practically rip), Oh My Girl, Gugudan, LOONA!!!, Twice, IOI (rip), f(x) (also basically rip), Stellar, Girl's Day, Blackpink-- and there's more that I love but don't keep up with as much. I love girl groups a lot. Hashtag had a good debut (imo) so I'm keeping my eye on them. I'm also trying to get to know Pristin and Weki Meki more. I LOVED Nayoung, Pinky, and Doyeon and Yoojung in P101 but I haven't kept up with their respective groups ;;;
<br><br>
I know you didn't ask for these but some other k-artists/soloists I love are IU (my ult female soloist), Suran, Sunmi, Hyuna, AKMU, GroovyRoom (I LOVE LOVE LOVE HWIMIN SO MUCH), Primary, Kream, Zion.T, Loco, HyukOh, OFFONOFF, 10cm, Ovan, Cheeze, Eyedi, ELO, Standing Egg, Bolbbalgan4, Wet Boyz (LISTEN, they're meme boyz) Park Seong Uk, Crush, Eddy Kim, pH-1 (I LOVE HIM), Sik-k, K.vsh, Summer Soul, Giriboy, Hoody, Miso, Sam Kim, Epik High, Jane Jang, 1415, 10cm, Neon Bunny, Lim Kim (she isn't in music anymore tho iirc), Often, Oohyo, Cherry Coke, Zitten, Lucy (used to be Jiyeon in GLAM, her solo debut song B-Day is really good!!)... 
<br><br>
There's a lot more but this has gotten way too long and honestly I'm using this to procrastinate so I'm going to stop now and go get some more emails done.
