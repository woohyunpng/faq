				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>My name is Sydney. I'm a 24 year old woman currently living in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When did you become a GOM?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>February 23, 2016. My first GO was for Silver Lining's 1st Photobook "BITTER SWEET".</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What groups do you open for?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I don't like to limit myself, but I'm primarily a Red Velvet, iKON Donghyuk and HIGHLIGHT manager. I also open for TWICE, VICTON, GNCD and PENTAGON.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there groups that you won't open for?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>BTS, EXO, Monsta X, GOT7. There are more than enough trustworthy managers for these groups already and I'm not needed.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you take requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Usually I'm open to requests, but I reserve the right to reject a request. Right now my requests are temporarily closed until I finish off all the seasons greetings orders.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What countries do you ship to?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Primarily USA and sometimes Canada. For most items going to international locations, I'll ship directly to you from my Korean address to save you money. Depending on where you're from, I may or may not be able to give you an estimate on the shipping cost.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO Info</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the process?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Please carefully read the entire form before filling it out!<br><br>

Usually 24-72 hours after submitting your form, you will receive a confirmation email from me along with an invoice for 1st payment.<br><br>

95% of the time, each order will have FOUR (4) PAYMENTS:<br>
- 1st payment: Cost of goods<br>
- 2nd payment: Shipping to Korean address + Paypal or bank transfer fees<br>
- 3rd payment: EMS shipping to me from Korean address<br>
- 4th payment: Domestic shipping<br><br>

Payment confirmation emails will usually be sent within 24-72 hours.<br><br>

2nd payment invoices will be sent once the information is available from the fansite.<br><br>

All updates regarding previews, shipping, deadline changes, etc. will be tweeted in my updates tag as I receive them from the fansite.<br><br>

When the goods arrive to my Korean address and are ready to be shipped in a box with other goods, I'll send out invoices for the 3rd payment.<br><br>

When the goods arrive to me in the USA, I will send out address confirmations first and then domestic shipping invoices.<br><br>

After I've shipped your goods, I will most likely update your tracking number on Paypal. Unless you have multiple packages, then I will email you with all your tracking numbers because Paypal only allows one to be entered.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you have a Korean address? How does it work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes.<br><br>
					
					I ship all orders (from Korea based fansites, of course) to my Korean address. Once there, Korgou will give me the weight of the package and I apply for them to take photos of the item. (This is because I get a tracking number like, 1 out of 50 times with a fansite, so unless I get the pictures I have no idea what item it is that's arrived.<br><br>
					
					Once I have enough orders arrived to fill a box pretty well, I apply for forwarding (shipping through DHL). DHL is the cheapest and fasted method to get to the USA so I always use it, but for when I'm shipping international orders, that's done on a case by case basis.<br><br>
					
					EMS for the box is divided up by item weight so that everyone is paying their fair share of the box. I have a spreadsheet that I use to do this.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you have a Korean bank account?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes. But it belongs to Korgou, not me personally.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does GO/GOM/EMS/DHL mean?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>GO = group order<br>
	GOM = group order manager<br>
	EMS = shipping method from Korea Post, expensive, with tracking, usually takes 2-6 business days for delivery<br>
	DHL = shipping method, expensive (but usually still less than Korea Post EMS), with tracking, usually takes 2-4 business days for delivery</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

		<ul id="ordering" class="cd-faq-group">
			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Ordering</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will I get a confirmation email?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Order confirmations should be automatic as soon as you submit the form, UNLESS you are a member of the Cool World Club. In that case, you should consider your 1st payment invoice as the confirmation of your order.<br>
					Payment confirmations should be received within 72 hours of submission. Sometimes these get delayed, so feel free to DM/email to check if it's been over 72 hours.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I missed a deadline, can I still order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The short answer: no. A lot of people will go over my head though and ask the fansite directly, which if the fansite says yes, then that's fine. But I'm not going to be the one to ask the fansite. I've had people join entire WEEKS after an order closes, which again is fine if the fansite gives the approval personally.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I drop out of an order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Before 1st payment = Yes.<br>
					After 1st payment = Yes, but ONLY if you find someone to buy your spot.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I ask for an update on my order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sure, but there's a good chance I may not have one. Anything I know goes in my updates tag, so if you don't see anything there, I won't have anything to tell you.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I split a set with someone?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you want to, sure. But it is your responsibility to find the person to split with, work out how you're splitting the set, etc. And if one person doesn't pay their share, I'm not going to cover it out of my own pocket; it will be counted as a missed payment and the entire order will be cancelled. So make sure you pick someone you trust to come through with their half of the payments.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>One Off Orders</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is a one off order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Suppose you see an item that you want, but there's no group order manager. Or there is a manager, but you don't know/trust/like them for whatever reason. Or there's a Korean site you want to order an item from, but they don't accept foreign cards. Or there is a low amount of people interested in a fansite item, but you still want to purchase it. That's where a One Off order comes in.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How are they different from GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The only real difference is that you pay for the shipping to the Korean address by yourself.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the process?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>1. You fill out the One Off order form with a link to your item (and what set/style/color/etc. details, if necessary)<br>
					2. I send you an order confirmation (or a cancellation notice if it's not possible) along with details on 1st payment.<br>
					3. You confirm the information and I send your invoice.<br>
					4. After you pay, I order through the fansite.<br>
					5. The rest proceeds like a normal GO in that we have to wait for the goods to finish production and arrive to my Korean address so they can be shipped.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long do they take?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The same time as regular GOs. The goods are still being produced the same way, so it's going to take just as long as a regular GO would.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are the EMS fees high?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where can I see updates on my order?</a>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there any restrictions?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I do not currently offer One Off orders to countries outside the USA, with the exception of fanclub memberships and people who already are in a regular GO with me. There are no restrictions on groups for One Off orders.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you want to buy an album that there's no group order for, a face cleanser that you can't get cheaply elsewhere, Korean clothing, etc. That's what a single Gmarket order would be.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How are they different from regular GOs?</a>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the process?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>1. You fill out my Single Gmarket order form with a link to the item(s) you want.<br>
					2. I check the prices and send you a confirmation email with the 1st payment details.<br>
					3. You confirm the information and I send your 1st payment invoice.
					4. I order everything together at the end of the month. If something goes out of stock, I will search for an alternative first before cancelling and refunding that part of your order.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long do they take?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

			</li>
	
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do I have to use the invoice?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This is to protect my account from being locked like other GOMs have had happen to them in the past. I also used to always have a few people in every order pay through Goods and Services WITHOUT telling me about it, so I've eliminated that problem for myself.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do I have to pay right away after submitting a form?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No. You can fill out the form on the 1st day I open an order and pay on the last day if you want. In fact, I prefer that you fill out the form as soon as possible because it is SO much harder to add someone last minute than it is to already have your information in the spreadsheet.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happens if I miss a payment?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Miss a first payment = Your order will be cancelled.<br>
	Miss a second (Korean address shipping)/third (EMS) payment = You get a 12 hour grace period after the deadline, then your order is cancelled. You will not get a refund UNLESS you can find someone to take your spot because now I'm going to have to pay your share of the EMS fee.<br>
	Miss a fourth (domestic) payment = Your goods will be resold. You will not get a refund UNTIL THEY SELL, and there will be a 10% service fee deducted from the amount because you wasted my time and treated my home like your personal storage unit.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>


			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I don't want the item anymore, can I get a refund?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Before 1st payment deadline = Yes. It's best to do it sooner rather than later, though. If you give me less than 3 days notice, that's a strike against you. If you do this 3 times, you will be banned from ordering with me in the future. You should be committed to an order when you sign up. I understand emergencies and unexpected things can happen, but it is still your responsibility to take care of things ASAP and not wait until the last minute.<br><br>
					
					After 1st payment deadline = ONLY if you can find someone to buy your spot.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I pay in installments?</a>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much will the EMS/DHL fee be?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I don't know. It depends on the weight of the item, the total number of orders, what other items are at the Korean address to be shipped at the same time, etc.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much is domestic (USA) shipping?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This varies depending on the type of item and shipping method, but I send most orders in a Priority Flat Rate Padded envelope which is $7.20. Other shipping methods that I use vary in cost based on weight and/or distance from me to you.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much is international shipping?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I ship everything internationally directly from my Korean address (except slogans and other light items for Canadian orders). It varies by country, item weight/size, shipping method used, etc. so I cannot give you a cookie cutter answer for it.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do you ship goods?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

				<div class="cd-faq-content">

			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When will my order ship?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I work a variable schedule, so whenever I find the time to ship, that's when it gets done. If you need something by a certain date (like for a gift), please let me know so I can prioritize your shipment! Do not abuse this system though, it will get you a strike on your record.</p>

					<p>The song "Cool World" by Red Velvet.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I become a GOM? Do you have any tips?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>First off, I only recommend becoming a GOM for fandoms that don't have any or only have a small amount. I promise you it's just gonna stress you out if you try to jump into a big fandom like EXO or BTS where there's already a million managers and some of them are REALLY territorial about certain group members and/or fansites. Also being new and dealing with the mass amounts of buyers in those fandoms is probably not the best way to start your GOM life because of the high stress levels. But that's just my opinion! So if you really wanna do it that way, then go for it.<br>
						
						Google spreadsheets and forms are your best friend, I promise.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do you decide what GOs to open?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This is taken directly from an Ask:<br><br>
					Honestly it's primarily based on groups and/or the specific members I like.<br><br>
					Then I decide based on need, like if there's a manager already that I see on the fansite's Twitter, I don't open. There's some Red Velvet fansites who I've handled their projects since mid-2016 who I'll always open for though.<br><br>
					The deadline and cost are additional factors, as well as if I know some of my regular buyers are also fans of that group/member and would be interested enough to buy it.<br><br>
					I'm less picky with what I open now than what I used to, because now that I use Korgou to bundle stuff I can still push through small orders without the EMS being ridiculously high.</p>
