			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>My name is Sydney. I'm a 24 year old woman currently living in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When did you become a GOM?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>February 23, 2016. My first GO was for Silver Lining's 1st Photobook "BITTER SWEET".</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What groups do you open for?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I don't like to limit myself, but I'm primarily a Red Velvet, iKON Donghyuk and HIGHLIGHT manager. I also open for TWICE, VICTON, GNCD and PENTAGON.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there groups that you won't open for?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>BTS, EXO, Monsta X, GOT7. There are more than enough trustworthy managers for these groups already and I'm not needed.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you take requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Usually I'm open to requests, but I reserve the right to reject a request. Right now my requests are temporarily closed until I finish off all the seasons greetings orders.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What countries do you ship to?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Primarily USA and sometimes Canada. For most items going to international locations, I'll ship directly to you from my Korean address to save you money. Depending on where you're from, I may or may not be able to give you an estimate on the shipping cost.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

		</ul> <!-- cd-faq-group -->

		<ul id="goinfo" class="cd-faq-group">
			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO Info</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the process?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Blah blah blah.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you have a Korean address? How does it work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you have a Korean bank account?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes. But it belongs to Korgou, not me personally.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does GO/GOM/EMS/DHL mean?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>GO = group order<br>
	GOM = group order manager<br>
	EMS = shipping method from Korea Post, expensive, with tracking, usually takes 2-6 business days for delivery<br>
	DHL = shipping method, expensive (but usually still much less than Korea Post EMS), with tracking, usually takes 2-4 business days for delivery</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Ordering</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will I get a confirmation email?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Order confirmations should be automatic as soon as you submit the form, UNLESS you are a member of the Cool World Club. In that case, you should consider your 1st payment invoice as the confirmation of your order.<br>
					Payment confirmations should be received within 72 hours of submission. Sometimes these get delayed, so feel free to DM/email to check if it's been over 72 hours.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I missed a deadline, can I still order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The short answer: no. A lot of people will go over my head though and ask the fansite directly, which if the fansite says yes, then that's fine. But I'm not going to be the one to ask the fansite. I've had people join entire <i>weeks</i> after an order closes, which again is fine if the fansite gives the approval personally.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I drop out of an order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Blah blah blah.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I ask for an update on my order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sure, but there's a good chance I may not have one. Anything I know goes in my updates tag, so if you don't see anything there, I won't have anything to tell you.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I split a set with someone?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you want to, sure. But it is your responsibility to find the person to split with, work out how you're splitting the set, etc. And if one person doesn't pay their share, I'm not going to cover it out of my own pocket; it will be counted as a missed payment and the entire order will be cancelled. So make sure you pick someone you trust to come through with their half of the payments.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How are they different from GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The only real difference is that you pay for the shipping to the Korean address by yourself.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long do they take?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The same time as regular GOs. The goods are still being produced the same way, so it's going to take just as long as a regular GO would.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are the EMS fees high?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I run a Gmarket GO every month for the entire month. Everything is ordered together at the end of the month after all payments are received. I do not order items individually unless the shipping for that item is free anyway.</p>

				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
	
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do I have to use the invoice?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This is to protect my account from being locked like other GOMs have had happen to them in the past. I also used to always have a few people in every order pay through Goods and Services WITHOUT telling me about it, so I've eliminated that problem for myself.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do I have to pay right away after submitting a form?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No. You can fill out the form on the 1st day I open an order and pay on the last day if you want. In fact, I prefer that you fill out the form as soon as possible because it is <b><i>so</i></b> much harder to add someone last minute than it is to already have your information in the spreadsheet.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happens if I miss a payment?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Miss a first payment = Your order will be cancelled.<br>
	Miss a second (Korean address shipping)/third (EMS) payment = You get a 12 hour grace period after the deadline, then your order is cancelled. You will not get a refund <b><i>unless</i></b> you can find someone to take your spot because now I'm going to have to pay your share of the EMS fee.<br>
	Miss a fourth (domestic) payment = Your goods will be resold. You will not get a refund <i><b>until they sell</b></i>, and there will be a <i><b>10% service fee deducted</b></i> from the amount because you wasted my time and treated my home like your personal storage unit.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I pay in installments?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much will the EMS/DHL fee be?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I don't know. It depends on the weight of the item, the total number of orders, what other items are at the Korean address to be shipped at the same time, etc.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I combine my orders?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If they're expected to arrive within a month of each other, yes. I don't have a ton of space to store items, so I can only keep items for this long before I need them out.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When will my order ship?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I work a variable schedule, so whenever I find the time to ship, that's when it gets done. If you need something by a certain date (like for a gift), please let me know so I can prioritize your shipment! Do not abuse this system though, it will get you a strike on your record.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where did the name come from?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The song "Cool World" by Red Velvet. It's one of my favorite songs of theirs and the lyric "If you feel out of place anywhere / I'll save a spot for you right here" has a very special meaning to me. I thought it was fitting to give my frequent buyers a name that shows how much I appreciate them continually ordering from me. :)</p>
